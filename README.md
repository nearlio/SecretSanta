# SecretSanta
what it says on the tin

you just run the thing and it'll generate a file called santa.txt with two columns that pair people together.
I used it for my own folks so the name's set in the source code sorry (just change em to your desires it's easy)
maybe i'll clean it up and make it actually functional for other people one day //shrug
