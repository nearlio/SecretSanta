what it says on the tin

you just run the thing and it'll generate a file called santa.txt with two columns that pair people together.
I replaced my names with letters up to G so just assign everyone a letter and go on from there.  There won't be folks assigned to themselves.
maybe i'll clean it up and make it actually functional for other people one day //shrug
